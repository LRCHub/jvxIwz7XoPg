I stood upon the listed bridge
Dividing different images
Logic vs emotion
Mountain stream vs the ocean
Will we ever learn?
Logic vs emotion
Politicians carry the motion
Will we ever learn?

I'll take you upstream,
Up to my origin;
My water clear as glass,
My beauty everlasting
I was here before you—
A million years before you—
And I can only warn you
I'll be here when you're gone...

"Leave my house alone!
I won't leave my home!"
Said the old lady,
Kneeling by the riverbank, crying
"Leave our valley alone!
You're destroying our home!"
Chorus the creatures,
Watching as their paradise disappears
Under the water

I'll take you downstream,
Down where they turn me green;
I suffer the indignity
Of administering your poisons to the sea
The impurity of maturity—
Teach them all the appreciation of beauty!

I stood upon the listed bridge
Dividing different images
Logic vs emotion
A mountain stream feeding an ocean
Politicians go through the motions
Displaying such a depth of devotion
Logic vs emotion
Seems to be a lot of confusion
There is no foregone conclusion
There is no simple solution
The answer lies in your emotions—
Let them speak to you!
