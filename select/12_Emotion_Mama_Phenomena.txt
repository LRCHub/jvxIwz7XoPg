How am i supposed to feel
Touch me, is this real?
For once im my life
Nearly found paradise

I've heard it all before
How can i be sure
Words can deceive
Only fools believe

Should love feel this way
Getting stronger every day?
My heart's an open door
Oh - give me more

I knew from the start
I'd lose my heart

Some things 'meant to be
It's all destiny

Emotion mama
I can't sleep
Am i in too deep?
Emotion mama
She's all i'm thinking of
Is this love?

So scared of letting go
Letting my feelimgs show
It's too late now
We'll make it somehow

A spark into a flame
Made me believe again
Love's coming back
Like it's never been gone

One shout to the heart
My world it falls apart
Try to pretend
Here i go again

Emotion mama
I can't sleep
Am i in too deep?
Emotion mama
She's all i'm thinking of
Is this love?

Play the game, no surprise
You saw it in my eyes
Love's not what it means
In my wildest dreams
